### Introduction

This post details the classes I took in my freshman year and what I thought of them. 

### Semester 1

I came in with several AP credits, but was only able to use my AP CS A and AP Calc BC credits to skip classes, namely, Calculus 1 & 2 as well as 15-110/15-112 which are Principles of Computing and Fundamentals of Programming. Both are pretty well taught classes from my friends that took them, albeit challenging if you don't come from a computing background. 

1. 21-127: Concepts of Mathematics
2. 36-200: Reasoning with Data
3. 15-122: Principles of Imperative Computing
4. 76-101: Interpretation and Argument
5. 66-132: Seminar

#### Concepts of Mathematics

Concepts goes over, well, concepts of mathematics. It mostly introduces proof-based mathematics with the main ideas being fundamentals in set theory, number theory, combinatorics, cardinality, logic, and functions.

It serves as the foundation to many more rigorous mathematics courses and often is the first proof-based class taken by CMU students. The most challenging concept for me was cardinality (uncountability and countability). 

The class is also pretty professor dependent. I tried taking 21-128, which I believe covers more topics (or maybe goes in more dpeth), but unfortunately did not fit in my schedule. However, I do hear that 21-128 / 15-151 taught by Professor John Mackey is really well taught. 

Although for the most part the class is pretty well taught, I still do think that many of the ideas are poorly motivated and that the class only exists to improve mathematical maturity. For that reason, many people might find it boring.

#### Principles of Imperative Computing

15-122 and Concepts is often a notorious coursework pair for freshman and I think it is one of the most common coursework pairs. Unfortunately, as of 2024, I believe they are reworking Fall 2024 15-122, so not sure how much of this will still apply. 

15-122 is infamously taught by Professor Iliano Cervesato as well as a second Professor that changes from semester to semester. I was taught by Professor Dilsun Kaynar, but Professor Cervesato's influence definitely can be felt through the entire class. 

I think people are pretty split on 15-122. The main concepts it allegedly introduces is imperative computing (although it pretty much fails to define it properly). However, you do come out of the class with a working knowledge of invariants and proving code correctness, which is invaluable. Even though people are split on 15-122, I think it can be agreed upon that it teaches a very important way of thinking about your code and how to approach coding.

In addition, you come out with a working knowledge of very basic and common data structures and algorithms, which is a plus.

Many of the programming assignments are pretty long but they are guided so it is more or less one of the easier aspects of the course. The writtens are a little more challenging and often have lots of tiny things that you can get marks off for. The tests are generally pretty challenging, with the main difficulty coming from the INSANE time crunch. 

I remember my first exam, sitting down, and realizing I had x amount of minutes with like 10 pages left and the testing anxiety kicking in so that was an amazing experience!

Compared to Concepts, the difficulty is comparable, but definitely a different time of difficulty. I think the work is better motivated than concepts, for sure, so it is definitely a little more enjoyable.

#### Reasoning with Data

Just go to class!!

This class was in the Mellon Institute, meaning I had to walk 20 minutes from my previous class to get there in time. If you can, try not to take this class in the Mellon Institute 

Gets 2/10 enjoyability just for that.

#### Interpretation and Argument

This was an okay class that tries to tie in research fundamentals with humanities. The class is too professor dependent to comment on.

***Enjoyability Rating: 6/10***

***Difficulty Rating: 10/10***

#### Seminar

It's a class for sure. Nothing special but nothing particularly bad about it. It's definitely what you make of it and also pretty topic dependent.

### Semester 2

This semester I took a lighter load and also got some gen-eds out of the way. 

1. 21-241: Matrix Algebra and Linear Transformations
2. 15-251: Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science
3. 82-282: Interpreting Global Texts and Cultures
4. 88-120: Reason, Passion, Cognition (RPC)

#### Matrix Algebra and Linear Transformations

Introduces matrix theory and briefly covers linear transformations at the end.

I took this class with Professor Junichi Koganemaru, who taught the class pretty well and was very kind. His exams were fair, and while the homeworks can get lengthy, they prepare you well for the exams.

Overall a pretty enjoyable class and teaches you important fundamentals for basically every other math class you will take at CMU or elsewhere.

The class was surprisingly well motivated and we covered some pretty interesting concepts. 

Just make sure to go to class :)

#### Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science

This class is one of the most notorious classes at CMU for undergraduates. It is one of the most well taught classes and likely one of the most well motivated classes. 

If you enjoyed concepts, you will enjoy this class, and if you didn't enjoy concepts, you will still enjoy this class. The class was rigorous and pretty difficult, but definitely not impossible. 

I have so many good things to say about this class, from the course staff to the class system to the notes system that it likely won't fit here, but I'll try.

First, in the beginning of the semester, you get assigned a mentor that you can always reach out to with questions. There are difficulty-ranked recitations that vary in difficulty and try to fit with your learning speed. The classes are recorded and has its own web page like Canvas that keeps track of all the material. Also, attendance is optionally for credit. The homeworks were mostly group work, with a few solo questions throughout. 

One interesting thing about the class was that homeworks were to be done throughout the week, and then every Wednesday, everyone would come in, closed notes, to answer the problems in the homeworks. I think the idea was to make sure that we knew the ideas by heart instead of just memorizing the proof, but I can't say for sure if this system really works. 

One of the best things about this class were the topics that were covered. They introduced me to some really deep ideas in mathematics and as you might imagine, cover most of the blog posts thus far. 

I took the course with Professor Anil Ada and Professor Feras Saad, who alternated teaching the lectures. 

The course is challenging so I was glad I took a lighter coursework but definitely not impossible. It was a really, really rewarding class. Maybe I'm a 15-251 glazer but I highly recommend!

#### Interpreting Global Texts and Cultures

Also known as Cultural Studies, this was a class to fulfill my humanities gen-ed. However, it turned out to be one of the most insightful classes I have taken in a very long time.

I took it with Professor Jose Estrada, who was very kind and taught the class with a lot of passion for the subject.

In class is heavily discussion based and although I didn't participate much, it was really insightful listening to all my peers. 

Outside of class, there were a lot of readings to do. Some of the readings were poorly motivated while the majority of them were really meaningful. There were no exams in the class but the readings made it pretty difficult to follow at times, so it would be pretty time intensive.

#### Reason, Passion, Cognition (RPC)

This class went so fast it was almost ridiculous!

I think the class was too broad while never going in depth to be particularly useful. The goal of the class was to make the people taking the class, RPCers, better thinkers, by pointing out common flaws that humans tend to make in decision making.

For example, we would cover heuristics, base rate neglect, some fallacies we tend to make, etc, in the hopes that when we make a decision, we know not to fall to those flaws. 

However, the tests were in general, a memorization nightmare, while the homework and classwork were otherwise pretty trivial in comparison. Doing well on homeworks or in class didn't necessarily translate to doing well in tests.

9. 88-120: Reason, Passion, Cognition (RPC)

Overall, most of the classes I took this year were really foundational, and gave me little room to explore some of the interests I had. However, they were important in the sense that it improved my technical skills in computing, mathematics, and reasoning.
