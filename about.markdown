hi, i'm chris, a freshman at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA. my interests are in mathematics, computer science, and physics!

this blog is a mini project for one of my classes and I intend to post semi-frequently on interesting problems/puzzles/lecture notes from my classes, everyday life, or just some random things here and there that I come across!

for if you want to reach out or find any bugs / typos:
